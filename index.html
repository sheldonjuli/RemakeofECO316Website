                    <p> Game theory is a set of tools for studying situations in which decision-makers (like consumers, firms, politicians, and governments) interact. This course provides an introduction to game theory, with a strong emphasis on applications in economics. The objective of the course is to give students an understanding of the core concepts of game theory and how to use them to understand economic, social, and political phenomena.</p>
                    
                    <p>Game theory is an anlytical subject, and an ability to follow logical arguments—including some that are complex—is required to follow the material. The only way to absorb analytical material is to work through problems. I will assign weekly problem sets; to keep up with the course it is essential that you complete them. </p>
                
                    <p>Important announcement from Associate Chair, Undergraduate Studies</p>

                <p>You are reminded that you can take <mark>only one (NOT both)</mark> of ECO316H and ECO326H, no matter how appealing you find game theory.</p>
                    
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        ECO316H and ECO326H are exclusions for each other -- that means you cannot take both courses towards your degree.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        ECO316H cannot be counted towards any program that requires ECO326H. In other words, if you need to take 
                        ECO326H for your program, you cannot take ECO316H.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Department of Economics will not remove students from courses that are exclusions. However, when the time comes to graduate and courses are counted, the rules will be enforced, and exclusions will not count toward the degree or program. Students are expected to comply with the rules of the calendar when they choose their courses.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p> To pass the course, you must achieve a <mark>minimum grade of 40%</mark> or higher on the final exam. This means that if your grade on the final exam falls below 40%, your final grade in the course will be capped at 40%. </p>

                <p>As with any analytical subject, the only way to learn the material in this course is to solve a lot of problems. I will assign a problem set each week. Your answers to these problems will not contribute directly to your grade (they will not be marked), but they will definitely contribute indirectly: you will not be able to do well in the course unless you do the problems. The problems will be taken up by the TA in the tutorial sessions. </p>

                <h3>Midterm</h3>
                <p>The midterm test will be held on <mark>Friday October 25, 1:10pm–3:00pm.</mark> The test will receive a weight of 40% in the final grade.</p>
                <h3>Final</h3>
                <p>The final exam will receive a weight of 60% in the final grade. It will cover the entire term's work. Much of the material in the second half of the course builds on the material in the first half, so it is difficult to say exactly how much of the exam relates to each part of the course. However, probably between a quarter and a third of the points on the final exam will be for problems that could be answered on the basis of the material in the first half of the course alone. </p>

                <h2>Help</h2>
                <p>If you have a question about the material in the course, I strongly encourage you to post it on the Forum. (Note that you can, if you wish, do so anonymously.) Doing so has several advantages. </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In formulating the question precisely, you may well find that you can answer it yourself.</li>
                    <li>You'll probably get a pretty quick response.</li>
                    <li>Everyone will see the question and responses.</li>
                    <li>While you are waiting for me to figure out how to answer the question you can update your Facebook page, watch American Idol, or continue reading Kierkegaard's Either/Or. Or possibly do all three.</li>
                    <li>You don't have to come to my office.</li>

                <p>The TA Marc-Antoine Schmidt holds weekly office hours from 2pm to 4pm on Mondays and from 3pm to 5pm on Tuesdays in GE40. </p>
                <p>During the 12 weeks of the teaching term, I will hold office hours every Friday from 3:10pm to 4pm, except as follows: in the weeks starting September 23, September 30, and October 7, my office hours will be on Thursday from 4:10pm to 5pm.</p>
